# Tensorflow-Practice
This is a collection of practice code developed throughout my self-learning experience with TensorFlow.

Reference book: "TensorFlow 2.x人工智慧、機器學習超炫範例200+", published by 碁峰資訊, 2021

The codes are not the same as the samples in the book. I have modified a piece of code according to my habits.



Note: steps of training a MLP model
1. collecting required data
2. preprocessing features or labels if needed
3. building a MLP model
4. compiling and training the model
5. testing the model and output the results
