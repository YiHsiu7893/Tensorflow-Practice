# Tensorflow-Practice
This is a collection of practice code developed throughout my self-learning experience with TensorFlow.

Reference book: "TensorFlow 2.x人工智慧、機器學習超炫範例200+", published by 碁峰資訊, 2021

The codes are not the same as the samples in the book. I have modified a piece of code according to my habits.

Note: steps of training a MLP model
1. collecting required data
2. preprocessing features or labels if needed
3. building a MLP model
4. compiling and training the model
5. testing and evaluating the ability of the model
6. predicting with the trained model

Note: approaches to improve accuracy of a model
1. adjust "epochs"
2. adjust "batch_size"
3. increase the number of neurons "units"
4. increase the number of hidden layers
5. increase the number of training data
